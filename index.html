                <h3>Why compost your kitchen waste?</h3>
                <p>Composting is the process of allowing microbes to break down your kitchen wet waste into organic fertilizer. <br><br>For this to happen, the microbes must be provided with the right conditions which are created by a composter. This helps reduce kitchen waste in landfills outside urban areas, and also in return gives you free organic compost that you can use for growing vegetables or microgreens such as coriander. <br><br> In a way, your kitchen waste can give back to your kitchen.</p>

                How are Marigold Solar Composters different from other composters?
            </summary>
            <div>
                Marigold Composters are made from stainless steel, and have minimal to zero usage of plastic parts. The main difference is in the way the composting is carried out. There is no need to add microbes or other activators to start or catalyse the composting process. The composting of food waste takes place entirely naturally by providing a medium of cocopeat and/or dried leaves.
            </div>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>
                Why do Marigold Solar Composters not need microbes?
            </summary>
            <div>
                Keeping the composter in sunlight and adding a medium such as cocopeat is sufficient to carry out the composting process. Microbes are naturally present in nature, and do not need to be specifically added to the medium.
            </div>
        </details>

            <summary>
                What are the materials used in making Marigold Solar Composters?
            </summary>
            <div>
                Marigold Solar Composters are made from a range of materials depending on the size, need and location for storing the composter. But generally, we ensure that a majority of the material used is stainless steel and glass. This is not only environmentally right but also long-lasting, durable and all-weather proof.
            </div>

            <summary>
                Can Marigold Solar Composters be used in harsh climates?
            </summary>
            <div>
                Yes, they can be kept outdoors in sun, rain, cold and a wide range of climatic conditions.
            </div>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>
                Does composting in Marigold Solar Composters produce any odour?
            </summary>
            <div>
                About 90% of instances do not produce any odour whatsoever. A small minority of instances may carry odour due to the nature of the food waste added to the composter. If you face any challenges with odour management with your Marigold Composter, we are happy to sort it out for you.
