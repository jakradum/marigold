                <h3>Why compost your kitchen waste?</h3>
                <p>Composting is the process of allowing microbes to break down your kitchen wet waste into organic fertilizer. <br><br>For this to happen, the microbes must be provided with the right conditions which are created by a composter. This helps reduce kitchen waste in landfills outside urban areas, and also in return gives you free organic compost that you can use for growing vegetables or microgreens such as coriander. <br><br> In a way, your kitchen waste can give back to your kitchen.</p>
