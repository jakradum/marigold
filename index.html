                <h3>Why compost your kitchen waste?</h3>
                <p>Composting is the process of allowing microbes to break down your kitchen wet waste into organic fertilizer. <br><br>For this to happen, the microbes must be provided with the right conditions which are created by a composter. This helps reduce kitchen waste in landfills outside urban areas, and also in return gives you free organic compost that you can use for growing vegetables or microgreens such as coriander. <br><br> In a way, your kitchen waste can give back to your kitchen.</p>

                How do you create an accordion?
            </summary>
            <div>
                Easy! As long as you don't have to support IE11 or older browsers you could use <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> natively.

            <summary>
                What if I have to support IE11 or older browsers?
            </summary>
            <div>
                No worries. The fallback for these elements is quite good. They will display as open. You won't get the open/close mechanism, but you won't lose any content either.
            </div>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>
                What type of content can I have inside one of these?
            </summary>
            <div>
                Almost anything you'd like. The <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element allows all <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#flow_content" target="_blank">flow content</a>, which is basically everything.
            </div>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>
                How does it work?
            </summary>
            <div>
                The <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element encapsulates the <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> element. The <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> becomes the 'label' for the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and acts like a button. When clicked, the attribute <code>open</code> is added to the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element, making it display. You can therefore style the open and closed states seperately if you'd like.
